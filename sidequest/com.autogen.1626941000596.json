{"apps_id": 4900, "name": "MoveUp", "summary": "In MoveUp, you control moving blocks as they jet across the sky. Your mission is to stop them precisely on top of one another to stack them. If you do the job well, you are rewarded with another block of the same size. However, if you fail to line up the blocks, the part left outside of the underlying block disappears and the next block you get is smaller. The smaller the blocks, the more challenging it is to stack them.", "app_banner": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/2360676/39031318_203150984988003_6919828517379640613_n.jpg", "image_url": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/2360676/39031318_203150984988003_6919828517379640613_n.jpg", "is_webxr": false, "versioncode": 1, "is_seated": false, "packagename": "com.autogen.1626941000596", "ab_enable": false, "labrador_url": "https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3919978298083658/?forced_locale=en_US", "supports_go": false, "supports_quest": true, "supports_pico": false, "supports_magic_leap": false, "supports_link": false, "early_access": false, "created": "1626941000596", "license": "FREE", "rating": "5.0000000000000000", "number_of_rating": "3", "downloads": "2461", "oculus_auto_generated": true, "oculus_auto_generated_creator": "Azi Social Media", "is_multi_url": false, "disable_reviews": false, "is_sidelined": false, "release_channels_enabled": false}
