{"apps_id": 5926, "name": "EmbodiMap", "summary": "EmbodiMap is a creative experience that enables users to connect with and explore how emotions, sensations, and stress responses are experienced in the body. Each time a feeling/sensation is identified, it can be drawn into an avatar figure. Users can freely move around or enter inside their avatar bodies. In this way, participants create and dynamically engage with a field of 3D sensory maps, which tell a story of changing sensation and awareness.", "app_banner": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/2358238/43931331_3909600322427649_7982141876882295988_n.jpg", "image_url": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/2358238/43931331_3909600322427649_7982141876882295988_n.jpg", "is_webxr": false, "versioncode": 1, "is_seated": false, "packagename": "com.autogen.1638260634374", "ab_enable": false, "labrador_url": "https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5315851651819402/?forced_locale=en_US", "supports_go": false, "supports_quest": true, "supports_pico": false, "supports_magic_leap": false, "supports_link": false, "early_access": true, "created": "1638260634374", "license": "FREE", "rating": "0", "number_of_rating": "0", "downloads": "2225", "oculus_auto_generated": true, "oculus_auto_generated_creator": "Feellab", "is_multi_url": false, "disable_reviews": false, "is_sidelined": false, "release_channels_enabled": false}
