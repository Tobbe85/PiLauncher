{"apps_id": 35614, "name": "Forklift Training Simulation", "summary": "The Forklift Training Simulation offers a safe and controlled environment for new operators to learn the fundamentals of forklift maneuvering.   This VR program utilizes a single forklift model in an open space with crates,  allowing users to practice movement and control techniques without the risk of real-world accidents.   This serves as an ideal starting point for forklift training,  building a solid foundation for new operators before they transition to more complex tasks in a warehouse setting.", "app_banner": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/636881/forklift-training-simulation.png", "image_url": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/636880/forklift-training-simulation01.png", "is_webxr": false, "versioncode": 1, "is_seated": true, "packagename": "ForkLift", "ab_enable": false, "labrador_url": null, "supports_go": false, "supports_quest": true, "supports_pico": false, "supports_magic_leap": false, "supports_link": false, "early_access": false, "created": "1720451153143", "license": "FREE", "rating": "0", "number_of_rating": "0", "downloads": "1609", "oculus_auto_generated": false, "oculus_auto_generated_creator": null, "is_multi_url": false, "disable_reviews": false, "is_sidelined": false, "release_channels_enabled": false}
