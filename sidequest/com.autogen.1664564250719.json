{"apps_id": 11063, "name": "The VR Chemistry Lab", "summary": "The VR Chemistry Lab was originally designed to be a research tool where studies of VR learning environments could be explored. Currently, it is still being used in research but has potential for student use as a hands-on science lab experience at home or at school. It also contains experiences where players can explore molecule creation in an immersive environment as well as play a game of catalyzing a chemical reaction.
