{"apps_id": 38517, "name": "AR Snake", "summary": "AR Snake brings a dynamic augmented reality experience to life, fully powered by hand tracking. Use the Materializer machine, with a circle to spawn items and an arrow to cycle between them. Procedurally generated snakes move fluidly through your environment, eating berries and growing larger. The new Combiner Orb lets you place Summoner disks inside, combining their DNA with random mutations to create new snakes with unique attributes. Watch your creations evolve as they interact with their surroundings.", "app_banner": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/1044318/banner0.png", "image_url": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/1059230/ar-snake-cover-11.png", "is_webxr": false, "versioncode": 18, "is_seated": true, "packagename": "com.pamagester.arsnake", "ab_enable": false, "labrador_url": "", "supports_go": false, "supports_quest": true, "supports_pico": false, "supports_magic_leap": false, "supports_link": false, "early_access": false, "created": "1729941145192", "license": "FREE", "rating": "3.0000000000000000", "number_of_rating": "2", "downloads": "2932", "oculus_auto_generated": false, "oculus_auto_generated_creator": null, "is_multi_url": false, "disable_reviews": false, "is_sidelined": false, "release_channels_enabled": false}
