You can manipulate objects in 3D space and create programs that draw geometric patterns. You can also control the execution of your programs and visualize changes to Pebbles the dog and the scene around her. You can move forward and backward in time, and zoom in and out of different levels of abstraction. You can also see the execution history of your programs as a 3D visualization.", "app_banner": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/2362876/39031653_707505697730639_5392829381188498339_n.jpg", "image_url": "https://cdn.sidequestvr.com/file/2362876/39031653_707505697730639_5392829381188498339_n.jpg", "is_webxr": false, "versioncode": 7, "is_seated": true, "packagename": "com.simulacrasystems.pebblegraphics", "ab_enable": false, "labrador_url": "https://www.meta.com/experiences/7189958484358658/", "supports_go": false, "supports_quest": true, "supports_pico": false, "supports_magic_leap": false, "supports_link": false, "early_access": true, "created": "1704049538620", "license": "FREE", "rating": "0", "number_of_rating": "0", "downloads": "142", "oculus_auto_generated": false, "oculus_auto_generated_creator": null, "is_multi_url": false, "disable_reviews": false, "is_sidelined": false, "release_channels_enabled": false}
